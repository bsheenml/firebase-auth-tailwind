### Firebase Authorization - React + Tailwind + Reach Router

This project follows the [LogRocket React + Firebase Auth](https://blog.logrocket.com/user-authentication-firebase-react-apps/) from a blank Create React App.

## Motivation

After cloning, modifying, and deploying multiple React + Firebase apps, I wanted to build one from scratch using Create React App. My goal is to practice my git commit flow while helping to ingrain the process of deploying a secure React + Firebase app to memory.

## Errors

Getting Error on 
`npm start`

`./src/Components/Application.jsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '../providers/UserProvider' in '/home/bsheen/firebase-auth-tailwind/src/Components'`

All imports and exports confirmed. I belive error is comming from Tailwind CSS installation. 

Next: Check Tailwind CSS installation.

Forking source code and configuring on my Firebase Services:
[firebase-auth-tailwind-fork](https://github.com/bsheenml/firebase-auth-tailwind-fork/)


## Installation

`npm install`
`npm start`
